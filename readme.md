# Zig Kata Machine

This is a little project where I rewrite the
[kata-machine](https://github.com/theprimeagen/kata-machine.git) in Zig. I would like to learn more
Zig and brush up on my algorithms so that is a nice project for that.

## Goal

1. Reimplement the solutions to the algorithms course from Prime.
2. Make a generation script in the `build.zig`.
3. Have others use this project and have fun with Zig and algos.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome!!!
